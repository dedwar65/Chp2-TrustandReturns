\subsection{Determinants of trust}

\par First, I go beyond correlations between the variables by trying to consider which variables explain the variation in the trust measures.  

\subsection{Income and trust}

\par After understanding the determinants of trust in the HRS data, I wanted to see if the \say{hump-shape} relationship between trust and income found by \cite{jbpglg2016} was present in the HRS data. To do this I used the available income data from the 2020 wave with the trust measures from the same year.

\subsection{Returns and trust}

\par With the hump-shape relationship between log earnings and trust present in the HRS, I wanted to see if a similar relationship held for returns. I used the formula from \cite{Daminato2024}: $$ r_t = \frac{y^c_t + cg_t -y^d_t}{A_{t-1} + .5F_t}   $$ where $y^c_t$ interest income and dividends, capital gains $cg_t$ measured as the difference between reported stock across waves, $F_t$ net investment flows, $y^d_t$ payments on debt (in the RAND longitudinal file, the variables were mentioned are all in net terms so this variable was $0$), and $A_{t-1}$ total net wealth at beginning of previous period.

\subsection{Returns from 2002-2022}

\par Next, I wanted to compute returns across several years and attempt to describe the persistent component of returns that \cite{aflgdmlp20} point to as heterogeneity across individuals. I also use three similar specifications. First, a pooled OLS regression with a baseline set of controls. Second, a similar pooled regression with aimed at controlling for risk exposure. Third, a panel regression with individual fixed effects and year dummies.

\section{The pooled regression with constant trust}

\par After looking at those specifications for the returns regressions, I wanted to see if the trust measure was significant in the pooled setting.
